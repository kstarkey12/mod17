# regex tutorial 
Regular expressions serve as templates for identifying character combinations within strings. Within these expressions, the metacharacter "^" is indicative of negation. Therefore, whereas the solitary "a" designates a search for the lowercase "a", the employment of "^a" signifies an intention to locate any character that does not conform to the lowercase "a".
Overview:
In this presentation, I will thoroughly explore the various components of a regular expression designed to match Hex Values. Hexadecimal code is a system that accurately describes colors for computers, ensuring precision and uniformity in electronic displays. A hexadecimal color value consists of a six-digit code preceded by a # symbol, defining colors for websites or computer programs. The regular expression /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/ is employed for this purpose.

##Anchors:
Anchors are unique elements within regular expressions that don't match characters but positions within the text. They anchor the regex match at specific positions. The caret (^) anchors the match before the first character, while the dollar sign ($) anchors it after the last character. For instance, applying ^a to "abc" matches the "a", but ^b doesn't match "abc" because "b" can't be matched right after the start of the string.

##Quantifiers:
Quantifiers indicate the expected number of characters. They can be greedy or lazy. Greedy quantifiers match as many characters as possible, while lazy ones match as few as possible. Symbols like *, +, ?, and {} are quantifiers. The "?" in the expression matches 0 or 1 occurrence. In the given Hex Value regular expression, we use the OR operator to distinguish between two formats. The {6} indicates Hex Triplet Format, and {3} indicates Shorthand Hex Format.

##OR Operator:
The "or" operator (|) in a regex separates different components, signifying that either component can be matched. In the Hex Value regex, the OR operator separates ([a-f0-9]{6}) and ([a-f0-9]{3}). This allows the hex value to be either 6 characters or 3 characters long.

##Character Classes:
Character classes specify the types of characters to expect in a regex. Enclosed within brackets [], they define search criteria. In the provided example, the character classes are [a-f0-9], used twice. This matches letters a-f and digits 0-9.

##Bracket Expressions:
Bracket expressions match any character within the square brackets. For instance, [nN] [oO] matches variations of "no," and gr[ae]y matches both "gray" and "grey."

##Greedy and Lazy Matching:
Greedy matching aims to match as much as possible, while lazy matching aims to match as little as possible. The "?" symbol in the example signifies a lazy quantifier. It makes the regex match as few occurrences as possible. To change this to a greedy match, adding a "?" suffices.

By understanding these components, we can effectively utilize the provided regular expression to identify and work with Hex Values.
